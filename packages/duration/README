# Duration

A Class to handle durations of time. Provides convenience methods to get the duration in seconds,
minutes, hours, days

## Installation

`npm install @time-utils/duration`

## Usage

```
import { Duration } from '@time-utils/duration';
```

The Class accepts a single argument, the number of milliseconds of the duration in question.

### Class Methods

`Duration.between` takes two Date instances and returns the Duration between those Dates

### Instance Methods

`duration.minus` accepts a Duration instance and returns a new Duration of the difference 
between the two.

### Instance properties

Durations contain multiple properties to get the value in different units of time. Available 
properties are:

* `milliseconds`
* `seconds`
* `minutes`
* `hours`
* `days`

Parts of the duration can get accessed using a singular form:

* `millisecond`
* `second`
* `minute`
* `hour`

As an example, 1300 milliseconds would return `300` for the millisecond part, and `1` for the 
second part
